E1:
	- Too much reverb on intro.
		- Oh it's wind...maybe tone it down slightly.
	- Too much compression
	- Why doesn't Sylas get to train with a gun more? His father's logic is he doesn't know how to hold a gun so he can't hold a gun. Though I can say this is not out of the ordinary for a somewhat concerned parent, esp. with a gun.
